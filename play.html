        SCENE I. Orchard of Oliver's house.
        <p class="stage-direction">Enter ORLANDO and ADAM</p>
        <h6 class="name">ORLANDO</h6>
        <p class="speech">As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
          bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
          and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
          blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
          sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
          report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
          he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
          properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
          that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
          differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
          are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
          with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
          and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
          brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the
          which his animals on his dunghills are as much
          bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
          plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
          me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
          me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
          brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
          gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
          grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I
          think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
          servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
          know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</p>
          <h6 class="name">ADAM</h6>
          <p class="speech">Yonder comes my master, your brother.</p>
          <h6 class="name">ORLANDO</h6>
          <p class="speech">Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will
          shake me up.</p>
          <p class ="stage-direction">Enter OLIVER </p>
          <h6 class="name">OLIVER</h6>
          <p class="speech">Now, sir! what make you here?</p>
          <h6 class="name">ORLANDO</h6>
          <p class="speech">Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.</p>
          <h6 class="name">OLIVER</h6>
          <p class="speech">What mar you then, sir?</p>
          <h6 class="name">ORLANDO</h6>
          <p class="speech">Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God
          made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.</p>
          <h6 class="name">OLIVER</h6>
          <p class="speech">Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.</p>
          <h6 class="name">ORLANDO</h6>
          <p class="speech">Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
          What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should
          come to such penury?</p>
