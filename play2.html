<p class="speech">Know you where your are, sir?</p>
<h6 class="name ORLANDO">ORLANDO</h6>
<p class="speech">O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.</p>
<h6 class="name OLIVER">OLIVER</h6>
<p class="speech">Know you before whom, sir?</p>
<h6 class="name ORLANDO">ORLANDO</h6>
<p class="speech">Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know
you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle
condition of blood, you should so know me. The
courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that
you are the first-born; but the same tradition
takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers
betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as
you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is
nearer to his reverence.</p>
<h6 class="name OLIVER">OLIVER</h6>
<p class="speech">What, boy!</p>
